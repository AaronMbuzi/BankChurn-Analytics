# BankChurn-Analytics
This is a complete end-to-end machine learning application that predicts whether bank customers will leave (churn) using logistic regression. It transforms a traditional data science workflow into an interactive web application that anyone can use through their browser.


## 🎯 What This Project Is
This is a complete end-to-end machine learning application that predicts whether bank customers will leave (churn) using logistic regression. It transforms a traditional data science workflow into an interactive web application that anyone can use through their browser.

## 🔍 Core Functionality
1. 🤖 Machine Learning Model
Algorithm: Logistic Regression (a classification algorithm)

Purpose: Predicts if a customer will stay (0) or leave (1) the bank

Input: Customer data (credit score, age, balance, tenure, etc.)

Output: Churn probability (0-100%) and binary prediction

2. 🌐 Live Web Application
Interactive Interface: Users can input customer details through forms

Real-time Predictions: Instant churn probability calculations

No Coding Required: Business users can make predictions without technical knowledge

3. 📊 Analytics Dashboard
Model Performance Visualization: ROC curves, confusion matrices

Feature Importance: Shows which factors most influence churn

Classification Reports: Detailed accuracy metrics

## 🔄 Complete Workflow (What the App Does)
Data Upload → Users upload customer data (Excel/CSV)

Automatic Preprocessing → Cleans and prepares data for modeling

Model Training → Trains logistic regression on the data

Live Predictions → Users can test new customer data

Performance Analysis → Visualizes how well the model performs
